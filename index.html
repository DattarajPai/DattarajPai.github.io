Hey, I am Dattaraj Pai. I am a writer from Goa, India. I write about science, philosophy, and human behaviour. To be specific I take complex ideas from science and philosophy and break them down into simple information that can be used in day to day life. That's my niche. 
</p>
<p>
I started writing two years ago. I started with Hubpages.com. By their definition it is an open community of passionate people--writers, explorers, knowledge seekers, etc. I learned a lot about writing there. Then I started reading books about writing and learned what I could about it. Books by Ayn Rand, Stephen King, and other greats. One thing I learned from all this is that the most important thing for a writer is to be true to yourself and to be honest.
</p>
<p>
I am a big fan of Independent learning. I have taught myself most of the skills I have. It's natural for me to try learning things by myself before seeking help of others (Google helps). I love it and am proud of it. Learning things, figuring out how to overcome obstacles in the process, being creative while doing it, I love all that. Although solving problems is my most favorite part. I feel like Dr. House when I do it. 
</p>
<p>
I learned web design to design a template for my blog, and also for this website. I am sort of a control freak (Nothing extreme) which I believe is a good thing because it helps me keep working on things till they're perfect.
</p>
<p>
I also write a blog, <a href="http://www.thinkerhood.com" target="_blank">Thinkerhood.com.</a> Visit it if you like.
