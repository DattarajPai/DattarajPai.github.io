<h3>Freelance writer and blogger from Goa, India.</h3>

	
		My name is Dattaraj Pai and I am a writer.
		<br>
<p>
	I am Dattaraj Pai from Goa, India. I am a writer and I write about pop culture, entertainment, and literature.
</p>

<p>
	My skills as a writer are, my writing voice that that makes people engaged, my ability to dig deep and dig creatively in finding information, and my tendency to submit only the best work (I edit vociferously).
</p>

<p>
	I learned from the best. Ayn Rand, Stephen King, and writing books by other great authors have taught me important things about writing.
</p>

<p>
	I am a writer when I am writing drafts, I am a journalist when I am doing research and looking for ideas, and I am a professional when I am submitting assignments.
</p>

<p>
	I am self taught in most things, and I am proud of it. I tend to do things myself because I aim for perfection. I learned web design so that I could design my own website from scratch (You like the design for this one?). This taught me that the things that appear difficult and intimidating at first are simple when you put your mind to learning them.
</p>

<p>
	I taught myself search engine optimization (SEO) when I first started writing a blog. Which taught me an obvious but very important life lesson: you learn by making mistakes, so don't be afraid to make them. I have observed that fear of failure can destroy one's chances of success.
