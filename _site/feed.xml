        <title>Handwriting or Typing - Which Goes Better With Writing?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;handwriting-or-typing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hemmingway&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft! Ernest Hemmingway advised writers to write with pencil. In an Esquire article he wrote he lays out the benefits of writing with the pencil over the typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When you start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none. So you might as well use a typewriter because it is that much easier and you enjoy it that much more. After you learn to write your whole object is to convey everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place and emotion to the reader. To do this you have to work over what you write. If you write with a pencil you get three different sights at it to see if the reader is getting what you want him to. First when you read it over; then when it is typed you get another chance to improve it, and again in the proof. Writing it first in pencil gives you one-third more chance to improve it. That is .333 which is a damned good average for a hitter. It also keeps it fluid longer so you can better it easier.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t disagree that adding one more step to editing will at some rate improve your writing, but even if we agree that, most of us are used to typing and enjoy it too much to switch. After years of writing, our thougts are associated to the sound of the keystrokes and the flow over the keys like a piano player performing a piece. Will switching to handwriting affect the creativity? Does it really make a difference? Will the writing improve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work in progress!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>100 Books to Blog About</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;books-to-blog-about.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moody&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have been trying to accomplish two things. 1. Write a blog, and 2. Read the classics. Both I really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried blogging before, many times, but I couldn’t blog because I never found the right topic to blog about. Something I’ll always be passionate about, and not run out of ideas to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B7LUVZK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00B7LUVZK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=giftscie-20&amp;amp;linkId=H67SMPVILXPV6EWH&quot;&gt;The Constellation Mug - Constellations Magically Appear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=giftscie-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00B7LUVZK&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the classics is what I have struggled to do for years, but recently my attention span has decided to go size zero. I begin to read, and after reading some twenty pages, I get distracted and postpone my literary endeavour. I haven’t finished Dickens’ &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt; or Jane Austen’s &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; even after several attempts (Thanks to my obsession with fresh starts and not so perfect memory, I always start from the beginning.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day I found a solution for both my problems, like Dr. House’s sudden strokes of genius, I had my own; I was watching &lt;em&gt;October Sky&lt;/em&gt; and I liked how the hero goes after his dreams even after his father’s strong disapproval, so I thought I should write about it and share my observations with others. Then I realised I could do the same things with books. That’s called killing two zombies with one headshot. I will blog about books. (And occasionally about movies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my blog I will write about books. Not just review them, but talk about them, the philosophies and how they are relevant to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/072098best-novels-list.html&quot;&gt;New York Times’ list of best 100 novels&lt;/a&gt;. Even those which I have read already. Won’t hurt to read &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; right now. It’s not on the list, and I don’t know why it isn’t, but it’s my favorite book, so I’ll do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
