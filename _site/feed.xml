        <title>100 Books to Blog About</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/books-to-blog-about.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moody&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have been trying to accomplish two things. 1. Write a blog, and 2. Read the classics. Both I really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried blogging before, many times, but I couldn’t blog because I never found the right topic to blog about. Something I’ll always be passionate about, and not run out of ideas to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the classics is what I have struggled to do for years, but recently my attention span has decided to go size zero. I begin to read, and after reading some twenty pages, I get distracted and postpone my literary endeavour. I haven’t finished Dickens’ &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt; or Jane Austen’s &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; even after several attempts (Thanks to my obsession with fresh starts and not so perfect memory, I always start from the beginning.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day I found a solution for both my problems, like Dr. House’s sudden strokes of genius, I had my own; I was watching &lt;em&gt;October Sky&lt;/em&gt; and I liked how the hero goes after his dreams even after his father’s strong disapproval, so I thought I should write about it and share my observations with others. Then I realised I could do the same things with books. That’s called killing two zombies with one headshot. I will blog about books. (And occasionally about movies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my blog I will write about books. Not just review them, but talk about them, the philosophies and how they are relevant to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/072098best-novels-list.html&quot;&gt;New York Times’ list of best 100 novels&lt;/a&gt;. Even those which I have read already. Won’t hurt to read &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; right now. It’s not on the list, and I don’t know why it isn’t, but it’s my favorite book, so I’ll do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
