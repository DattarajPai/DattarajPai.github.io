Draft! Ernest Hemmingway advised writers to write with pencil. In an Esquire article he wrote he lays out the benefits of writing with the pencil over the typewriter. 

*"When you start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none. So you might as well use a typewriter because it is that much easier and you enjoy it that much more. After you learn to write your whole object is to convey everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place and emotion to the reader. To do this you have to work over what you write. If you write with a pencil you get three different sights at it to see if the reader is getting what you want him to. First when you read it over; then when it is typed you get another chance to improve it, and again in the proof. Writing it first in pencil gives you one-third more chance to improve it. That is .333 which is a damned good average for a hitter. It also keeps it fluid longer so you can better it easier."*

You can't disagree that adding one more step to editing will at some rate improve your writing, but even if we agree that, most of us are used to typing and enjoy it too much to switch. After years of writing, our thougts are associated to the sound of the keystrokes and the flow over the keys like a piano player performing a piece. Will switching to handwriting affect the creativity? Does it really make a difference? Will the writing improve?

Work in progress!
